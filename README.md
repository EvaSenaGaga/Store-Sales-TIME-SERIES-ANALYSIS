Time series forecasting is the use of a model to predict future values based on previously observed values.
It is an important strategy for grocery stores to forecast sales, that knowing how many sales are needed in advance to avoid overstocking or understocking. In this article, sales data from Ecuadorian-based grocery retailer 'Corporacion Favorita' was analyzed, with the aim to predict and forecast product sales for their stores. The data consists of a set of multiple files:
Additional information from the data description notes that earthquake happened on 2016-04-16 in Ecuador, which had a significant impact on sales for several weeks after the earthquake. 
The analysis goal for this report is summarized into the following research questions: 
1.	Is the train dataset complete (has all the required dates)?
2.	Which dates have the lowest and highest sales for each year?
3.	Did the earthquake impact sales?
4.	Are certain groups of stores selling more products? (Cluster, city, state, type)
5.	Are sales affected by promotions, oil prices and holidays?
6.	What analysis can we get from the data and its extractable features?
7.	What is the difference between RMSLE, RMSE, MSE (or why is the MAE greater than all of them?
